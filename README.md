# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

I created an Amazon-like storefront CLI app with the MySQL database. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

## How the app works

Running the application, it populates all the items on sale from the bamazon database's table products on the screen in a table format. Customers are then first asked to choose the product they want to purshase. After prompting customer about the item they want to purshase, app then asks them the quanity of the item they would like to purshase. System also validates that the customer enters the valid entry and quanity based on the inventory; and if the entry is correct, the item is deducted from the inventory and the stock is updated. System also allows user to exit the store anytime by pressing the key "Q". on the keyboard!

## Getting Started

You will need to fork this repository and pull it to your local drive. Once this is done You will also need to install the npm packages stated in the package.json file to the current folder. You will be using the  `node bamazonCustomer.js` command in the current terminal of `bamazon` repo to run the app.
